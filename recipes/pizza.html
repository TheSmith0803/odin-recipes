        <p><h3>Recipe:</h3></p>

        <p><h4>Step 1:</h4></p>
        <p>Heat the oven to 500 degrees, with a 16-inch diameter pizza 
            stone placed on lowest shelf position, for at least 30 
            minutes.</p>

        <p><h4>Step 2:</h4></p>
        <p>Pour warm water into a small bowl. Add sugar, and sprinkle 
            in yeast. Using a fork, stir the mixture until yeast is 
            dissolved and water has turned a tan color. Let yeast stand 
            until foamy, about 10 minutes. In a food processor, use blade 
            to combine the 2 3/4 cups flour and salt, and pulse three to 
            four times. Add yeast mixture and 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil. 
            Pulse until the dough comes together, adding more flour as 
            needed until dough is smooth, not tacky, when squeezed. 
            Transfer to clean surface; knead four or five turns into a 
            ball.</p>

        <p><h4>Step 3:</h4></p>  
        <p>Brush the inside of a medium bowl with olive oil, and place the 
            dough in the bowl, smooth side up. Cover tightly with plastic 
            wrap, and place in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 
            40 minutes. Remove plastic wrap, and press your fist into the 
            center of the dough to punch it down. Fold the dough back onto 
            itself four or five times. Turn dough over, folded-side down, 
            cover with plastic wrap, and return to the warm spot to rise 
            again until the dough has doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</p>  
        
        <p><h4>Step 4:</h4></p>
        <p>Punch down the dough, and transfer to a clean surface. Using a 
            bench scraper or a sharp knife, divide the dough in half, and 
            knead each half four or five turns into a ball. Place one of 
            the dough balls back in the oiled bowl, and cover with plastic 
            wrap. Lightly flour a clean surface, place the remaining dough 
            ball on top, pat into a flattened circle, cover lightly with 
            plastic wrap, and let rest 5 minutes. Using your fingers, 
            begin to flatten and push the dough evenly out from the center 
            until it measures about 7 to 8 inches in diameter. Do not press 
            the dough all the way to the edges. Leave a slightly raised 
            border, about a half-inch wide, around entire circumference of 
            pizza dough.</p>

        <p><h4>Step 5:</h4></p>
        <p>Sprinkle cornmeal all over the surface of a pizza peel, and set 
            aside. Lift the dough off the surface, and center it on top of 
            your fists. Hold your fists about 1 to 2 inches apart. Begin 
            to rotate and stretch the dough, moving your fists until they 
            are 6 to 8 inches apart and the dough is several inches larger. 
            Then place your fists under the inside of the outer edge, and 
            continue to stretch the dough a little at a time until it 
            reaches about 12 inches in diameter. The dough will drape down 
            over your forearms. At this stage, it is important to keep 
            your fists along the inside of the outer edge and watch that 
            the dough does not get too thin or tear in the center. At the 
            same time, make sure to maintain the slightly raised border on 
            the edges. The dough is surprisingly resilient and will not 
            tear if this step is done carefully and slowly.</p>
        
        <p><h4>Step 6:</h4></p>
        <p>Arrange the pizza dough into a circle on top of the 
            cornmeal-dusted peel. Leaving the raised edge uncovered, 
            pour 9 tablespoons of the pizza sauce onto the dough. Using 
            the back of a tablespoon, evenly spread the sauce leaving a 
            half-inch border of dough uncovered. Arrange half of the 
            mozzarella slices on top of the sauce.</p>
        
        <p><h4>Step 7:</h4></p>
        <p>Lift the pizza peel and, using a slight jerking motion, slide 
            the pizza about one inch back and forth on the peel to 
            loosen it. Slightly tilt the peel, and place the front tip of 
            peel on the back side of the stone. Slide the pizza off the 
            peel, centering it on the stone. Bake until the crust is 
            golden brown and crisp on the edges and the bottom, 10 to 12 
            minutes, turning the pizza halfway through baking. While first 
            pizza is baking, shape and assemble a second pizza using 
            remaining dough. Using tongs, lift the edge of the first pizza, 
            and slide the peel all the way under to remove it from the 
            oven. Using a pizza wheel, slice the pizza into eight pieces, 
            and serve immediately.</p>
