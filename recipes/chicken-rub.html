        <p>I went looking for a new chicken rub recipe when I started
            trying to eat healther. In terms of lean protien, chicken is 
            my go to. However, after I started eating it more I got bored 
            of using only italian breadcrumbs, so I started looking up 
            different rubs to put together for the chicken. The thing 
            really makes this one taste good, is the brown sugar.
            When you bake the chicken in the oven with the brown sugar
            on top of it, it caramelizes and creats a kind of sweet 
            breading. The other special part is for sure the 
            cayenne pepper. I love spicy, so this is perfect for me.
            I hope you like this basic chicken rub as much as I do.

        <h3><p>Recipe ingredients:</p></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>2 tablespoons</b> brown sugar</li>
            <li><b>1 tablespoon</b> paprika</li>
            <li><b>2 teaspoons</b> dried oregano</li>
            <li><b>1 teaspoon</b> garlic powder</li>
            <li><b>1 teaspoon</b> salt</li>
            <li><b>1/2 teaspoon</b> onion powder</li>
            <li><b>1/2 teaspoon</b> black pepper</li>
            <li><b>1/4 teaspoon</b> cayenne pepper [1/2 teaspoon if you're brave]</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><p>Recipie procedure:</p></h3>

        <p><h4>Step 1:</h4></p>
        <p>Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and whisk or stir 
            until well blended.</p>

        <p><h4>Step 2:</h4></p>
        <p>To use, generously rub over chicken thighs, breasts, 
            drumsticks, or tenders or a whole chicken before cooking. 
            You can first rub some olive oil over the chicken to help 
            the rub stick to the meat better.</p>

        <p><h4>Step 3:</h4></p>
        <p>For the most flavor, let the rub marinate on the meat 
            for 1 hour (and up to 12 hours) in the refrigerator before 
            cooking. Discard any rub that has come in contact with raw 
            chicken or your hands when rubbing on the chicken.</p>

        <p><h4>Step 4:</h4></p>
        <p>Cook chicken as desired, such as in the oven, on the grill 
            or in an air fryer, Instant Pot or slow cooker.</p>
