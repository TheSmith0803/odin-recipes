My first actual website! (sort of)

Written before website completion:

    This website should contain an index page with links to several pages
    each containing different recipes.

During making:
    
    I just want to update this with a commit and say I am really enjoying
    this, I know I haven't even scratched the surface yet, but I like the 
    feeling of 'making something' :D

    So I think I am about finished. Made 3 pages with stuff on them.
    About to see if there's anything left to do.

After:

    Turns out I am finished! Seemed sorta repetitive and 
    simple. Eager to get on with some more complicated design and stuff.
    Maybe html feeling simple is a good thing? 

    I suppose html IS simple anyway. That's what everyone says.
    Dont know wether to be excited or scared for CSS lol.
